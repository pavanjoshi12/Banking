  description: |
    "The Account service supports operations to manage product accounts serviced by financial institutions. An account is a product serviced by a financial institution (FI) that carries a balance (credit or debit) in a particular currency. Generally account types fall into one of two major classifications: deposit or loan product account. Consumers use this service to retrieve information about accounts but it is also used by consumers to create new account product and maintain the information of these account products."
